Whisper Between Stars

The night folds in, a velvet tide,
where silver threads of starlight glide.
A hush drapes over field and tree,
as if the earth forgot to breathe.

The moon leans low, her lantern pale,
spilling dreams along the trail;
each shadow hums a secret tune,
a promise kept beneath the moon.

And in that stillness, soft and far,
your name drifts upward—past the star—
to rest where silence learns to sing,
and time forgets its tethered wing.

Would you like me to also give you a short analysis of the imagery and techniques I used in this poem?
